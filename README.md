<h2>Game Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Setup:</h3>

<p>The deck is divided equally among the players, so that each player has a down stack.</p>

<h3>In play:</h3>

<p>After that, the top card of each player's deck is flipped over and compared. The player with the highest card  value wins both cards.</p>

<h3>War:</h3>

<p>If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next three cards face down and then another card face-up and is compared as normal. The player with the highest card then wins all of the "war" cards.</p>


<h3>Game over:</h3>

<p>The game ends when one player holds all of the cards.</p>


<h4>Future enhancements:</h4>

<p>Adding a choice to reshuffle the deck when the player thinks all good cards are gone. Also, adding the reinforcement choice where the players draw 2 cards and choose which card will be played.</p>
